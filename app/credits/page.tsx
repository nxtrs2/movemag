                  This digital archive of Move magazine is made possible with
                  thanks to Asneem who provided the original print copy in
                  fantastic condition for digitisation. <br />
                  He has no idea how he ended up with it in the first place.
                  That is a mystery that will remain unsolved. Thanks anyway,
                  man!

                  However, the cover was missing from that copy. A scan of the
                  cover was provided by Mohamed Faisal - the then editor of this
                  issue of Move Magazine - who went on a long journey and a
                  mission and &ldquo;dug deep&ldquo; to find it. He also
                  graciously wrote the Foreword for this issue. Many thanks to
                  him for that and we hope he found his way back!
